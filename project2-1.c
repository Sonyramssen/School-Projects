Outputting the total loan amount, the principle, and finally the amount of interest paid. * - Author: N01407911* - Date: 10/24/2021*/#include <stdio.h>#include <math.h>#include <stdlib.h>      double mortageYears(double ,double);// declaration of functions      double mortagePrinciple(double, double);      double mortageInterest(double ,double);      double paymentFunction(double,double,double);      void myFunction(double,double,double,double);      int main(void)//main Function       {         double const maxYears = 40;//defined constant with min and max          double const minYears = 2;         double const maxPrinciple = 2000000;//defined constant with min and max          double const minPrinciple = 5000;         double const maxPaidinterest = 20;//defined constant with min and max          double const minPaidinterest = 1;          double years = mortageYears(maxYears, minYears);          double principle = mortagePrinciple(maxPrinciple, minPrinciple);          double paidInterest = mortageInterest(maxPaidinterest, minPaidinterest);         double finalPayment = paymentFunction(principle,paidInterest,years);         myFunction(finalPayment,years, paidInterest,principle);        return 0;       }// end main      double mortageYears( double maxYears, double minYears)       {//ask the use to enter inputs within a range, unless a 0 is entered program will close.      double years;     printf("Please enter in the number of years (2 to 40) for the following loan, or enter zero to exit: ");         scanf("%lf", &years);                while  (years < minYears || years > maxYears){                 if  (years == 0)           exit(0);// end the program           printf("Please enter a different value or zero to exit: \n");           scanf("%lf", &years);                }                               return (years);      }// end mortageYears     double mortagePrinciple(double maxPrinciple,double      minPrinciple)      {//ask the use to enter inputs within a range, unless a 0 is entered program will close.             double principle;     printf("Please enter in the total amount  (5 thousand to 2 million) for the following loan, or enter zero to exit: ");         scanf("%lf", &principle);     while (principle < minPrinciple || principle > maxPrinciple){                     if (principle == 0)      exit(0);// end the program              printf("Please enter a different value or zero to exit: ");     scanf("%lf", &principle);               }           return (principle);     }// end mortagePrinciple          double mortageInterest(double maxPaidinterest, double minPaidinterest)         {//ask the use to enter inputs within a range, unless a 0 is entered program will close.       double paidInterest;       printf("Please enter in the interest rate (1 to 20) for the following loan, or enter zero to exit: ");         scanf("%lf", &paidInterest);     while (paidInterest < minPaidinterest || paidInterest > maxPaidinterest){               if (paidInterest == 0)     exit(0);// end the program     printf("Please enter a different value or zero to exit: ");     scanf("%lf", &paidInterest);     }         return (paidInterest);     }//end mortageInterest             double paymentFunction(double principle,double paidInterest, double years){              double P = principle;      paidInterest = paidInterest /100;      double monthlyRate = paidInterest /12.0;      double base = 1 + monthlyRate;      double month = years * 12;          double finalPayment = P * ((monthlyRate * pow(base,month))/(pow(base,month)-1))+0.000001;//calculates the monthly payment for the loan       return (finalPayment);     }     void myFunction( double finalPayment, double years, double paidInterest, double principle)   {//takes the finalPayment and prints out amortization table from first month until the last.  double annualPayment; int currentMonth = 1; double principleA; double finalPrinciple; double interestB;  int i=1;         principleA = principle;    double monthA = years * 12;//turns years entered into months    double totalLoan = finalPayment * monthA;// calculates total loan amont    double totalInterest = totalLoan -
